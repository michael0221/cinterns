                            <p>My stay at Cinfores has been a memorable one so far. Everyday I report to work, I leave with a plus. At first it seemed a bit rough but it has definitely been worth the stress. I’ve gained more confidence with my works compared to when I first walked in to the company. The environ is a conducive one with people that are more than mere colleagues but family.</p>

                            <p>I spent 3 months at cinfores. It was a period which I learnt a lot. When I came to the company, I had in mind that I would work with a team. I prepared my mind for that; To be able to work with anybody. Idealab was full of people I could look up to. Hard working people who worked with one mind. A team. With people like this, everyday was inspiring. I am grateful for everyone I had around. Who made work a little more bearable till I loved it and now it's all over, I can look back and say my 3 months were worth it. </p>
